# README

Weather Powered Email allows a user to sign up with an email address and a location, which they choose from a list of the 100 most populated cities in the United States. Upon sign-up, the user will receive an email to their submitted email address which contains a personalized message based on the weather at that location.

The live version of the app is available at weather-powered-email.herokuapp.com

# Instructions

To run the app locally, clone the repo to your local machine and then start a local Rails server and go to localhost:3000 in your browser of choice. Once the page loads, enter your email address and choose a city from the dropdown list. Once you submit, you will be redirected to a new page, and through the Letter Opener gem, the sent email will appear in a new tab in your browser.
